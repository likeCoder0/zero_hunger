            We Indians love to eat as well as feed others. For this very reason, every time we have a function or a party, we ensure that thereâ€™s plenty of food around. After all the eating, drinking, and merriment, we often end up with a lot of leftover food. While some of it can be packed off to friends and relatives, most of it goes to waste. Often, after a big party at home is over, we wonder what to do with the food.
